		A continuous function is when its' return values can be written on a graph without being able to lift your pen off the paper.
	5.
		Discrete data is where there is only a fininite of possible answers.
	6.
		An example of a datatype which contains discrete data is an Integer, while a datatype which holds continuous data is a float
