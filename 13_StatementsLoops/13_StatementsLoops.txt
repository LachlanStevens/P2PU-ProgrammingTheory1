1.
	For a guessing game a while loop would be used due to us not wanting to limit the amount of guesses.
2.
	from random import randint

	randNum = randint(1,99)
	userInput = 0
	guessCount = 0

	print "Welcome to a guessing game."


	while(userInput != randNum):
		userInput = int(raw_input("Enter guess: "))
		if(userInput < 0 or userInput > 100):
			print "Sorry, that number is out of range. Please enter between 0 and 100."
		else:
			if(userInput < randNum):
				print "Oh try again, maybe a little higher?"
			if(userInput > randNum):
				print "Hmm, Maybe lower?"
		guessCount = guessCount + 1

	print "Congratulations! you correctly guessed the number %d. It took you %d tries." % (randNum, guessCount)
